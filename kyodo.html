        <h5>PROBLEM</h5>
        <h3>Freelancers want clear approvals</h3>
        <p>Although the cloud storage market has tough competitors, none meet all the unique needs of freelancers. Freelancers rely on securely sending and storing files and, most importantly, receiving clear feedback from their clients, a feature currently unavailable in existing products.</p>

      <section class="content__casestudy">
        <h5>USER SURVEY</h5>
        <h3>Understanding users and their current habits</h3>
        <p>I created a survey to understand if and how people are using current products on the market. Questions revolved around which apps are being used, most used features, and any pain points or frustrations.</p>
        <img src="images/kyodo/kyodo_surveyresults.png">
        <h6>Results from the survey showed that users mainly use cloud storage apps to share files with others</h6>

        <ul class="text__takeaways">
          <li><p class=card">Users prioritize being able to share files/folders, have ample storage space, and collaborate with others</p></li>

        <div class="learningmoment">
          <img src="images/kyodo/icon_lightbulb.png"><h4>LEARNING MOMENT</h4>
          <p class="card">Many users responded that organization features are not a high priority. Interestingly, a common pain point was the inability to easily find certain files. I learned that user surveys may yield conflicting results and it’s up to the designer to intuitively analyze that organization is a priority.</p>

            <p class="card">As a UX writer, Bella needs to be in constant communication with her client. From understanding the brief, asking the right questions, and providing QA, there’s a lot of touch points in her process. However, switching between her email, writing program, and cloud storage has been a huge pain. Ideally, Bella would like to work within the same program to write, communicate, and organize her files. Since she’s often working with multiple clients at once, she likes to keep her work organized by date and client.</p>

        <p>To test the prototype, I asked three users to complete the following tasks:</p>
          <div class="blockquote">
            <ul>
              <li>Sign up for an account</li>

            <li>Many clicked the social media sign up buttons before entering their own information</li>
            <li>Sorting was not as intuitive since the content could only be sorted by using the dropdown, instead of just clicking on the category (e.g. Last modified).</li>
            <li>Tab groups in the details popup did not match the overall UI of the app.</li>

        <h5>LOGO</h5>
        <h3>Creating a brand identity that embodies the heart of the app</h3>
        <p>The name Kyodo was derived from the Japanese word 共同 (kyōdō) meaning <strong>cooperation, collaboration, and partnership.</strong></p>
        <p>Continuing with the Japanese theme, I explored a logo resembling a hanko or stamp used to sign off on documents. <strong>In Japan, a hanko is required to approve any process or document, which connected to Kyodo’s feedback feature.</strong></p>

        <img src="images/kyodo/kyodo_logosketches.png">
        <h6>Mindmapping, studying hanko designs, and sketching for Kyodo’s logo</h6>

        <p>After lots of exploration, I settled on my three strongest designs. To make the final decision, I deployed a preference test for user input.</p>

        <img src="images/kyodo/kyodo_3logos.png">
        <h6>option 1</h6>
        <h6>option 2</h6>
        <h6>option 3</h6>

        <p>And the results were in -- option 3 was the most popular! Many participants noted how the loop suggests connectedness and that the design was the most scalable.</p>
        <p>The only revision I made for the final design was thickening the stroke between the overlapping loops.</p>

The sign painting style was a great display font that would serve as a unique identifier for Kyodo. The cursive also helped enforce the “connectedness” theme.</p>

        <p>For the body font,<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Raleway">RALEWAY</a> an elegant san serif designed by Matt McInerney, Pablo Impallari and Rodrigo Fuenzalida. It was the perfect, minimal complement to Calafia.</p>

        <h5>REVISIONS - ROUND 1</h5>
        <h3>Combining style and user feedback</h3>
        <p>With the app’s branding established, I created the high-fidelity prototype. When designing this iteration, I made sure to implement my learnings from the first round of user testing.</p>

        <div class="card__revision">
          <h5>HOMEPAGE COPY</h5>
          <p class="card">Edited the copy to better explain the app’s purpose</p>
          <h5>SIGN UP</h5>
          <p class="card">Switched the order of the sign up form and social media buttons to encourage users to sign up directly with the app</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card__revision">
          <h5>SORTING</h5>
          <p class="card">Changed sorting to category names above their respective columns</p>
          <h5>BUTTON REARRANGEMENT</h5>
          <p class="card">Following common UI patterns, added storage capacity to bottom of sidebar and moved app menu buttons to top right corner</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card__revision">
          <h5>UI STYLE</h5>
          <p class="card">Changed popup tab UI to match overall style</p>

      <!-- Preference test -->

      <section class="content__casestudy">
        <h5>USER PREFERENCE TESTS</h5>
        <h3>Turning to users for design input</h3>
        <p>When flushing out the design details of the UI, I ran into some intense heated debates (with myself) about style. Instead of continuing my one woman showdown, I turned to preference tests to hear user input. I utilized UsabilityHub to give me concrete, data-driven results.</p>

        <div class="card__revision">
          <h5>POPUP VS DROPDOWN</h5>
          <p class="card">Users overwhelmingly preferred the dropdown tray (67%) to the popup (33%). One user wrote the popup disrupted their view so they preferred a smoother transition.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card__revision">
          <h5>SIDEBAR COLOR</h5>
          <p class="card">Users preferred the pink (59%) to the white (49%). However, comments showed the pink attracted their attention. So I chose the white to keep the focus on the file contents.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card__revision">
          <h5>ICONOGRAPHY</h5>
          <p class="card">Users largely preferred the line icons (71%). The texts were second (29%) and the circular at dead last (0%). The preference was unanimous so I chose the line icons!</p>
        </div>

        <div class="learningmoment">
          <img src="images/kyodo/icon_lightbulb.png"><h4>LEARNING MOMENT</h4>
          <p class="card">Although the preference test results were super helpful, I learned that you should not always take the responses as is. In the sidebar color test, I saw that the pink was preferred for the wrong reasons. A designer must always analyze the meaning behind the user’s input!</p>

      <!-- User Testing - Round 2 -->

      <section class="content__casestudy">
        <h5>USER TESTING - ROUND 2</h5>
        <h3>Brand new features may require guidance</h3>
        <p>After completing the high-fidelity prototype, I deployed a second round of user testing. This time, I focused the tasks to test usability of fundamental features that distinguish this app from competitors:</p>
        <div class="blockquote">
          <ul>
            <li>Sign up for a "Freelancer" account</li>
            <li>Upload a file/folder, create a folder</li>
            <li>Sort contents of the folder by ascending date</li>
            <li>Submit the folder for feedback to client/li>
            <li>Sign in with a “Client” account</li>
            <li>As the client, mark file as "Approved"</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h4>WHAT WORKED:</h4>
          <div class="blockquote">
            <ul>
              <li>No issues with signing up/in or logging out</li>
              <li>No confusion about whether they were in the freelancer or client portal</li>
              <li>No issues with uploading or creating content</li>
              <li>No confusion about how to sort files or changing sort direction</li>
            <ul>
          </div>

          <h4>WHAT DIDN'T WORK:</h4>
            <div class="blockquote">
              <ul>
                <li>Users were confused about how to submit files for feedback. The task required too many touch points and was buried too deeply in the UI</li>
                <li>Even after submitting files for feedback in the freelancer portal, some users had trouble tracing the same steps to submit approval in the client portal</li>
            </div>

            <div class="learningmoment">
              <img src="images/kyodo/icon_lightbulb.png"><h4>LEARNING MOMENT</h4>
              <p class="card">The challenge I ran into here was users were unfamiliar with a new feature like approving/rejecting a file. I was stuck on the thought that good UX doesn’t need explanation, but I learned that a quick tutorial to introduce brand new features can help users better interact with your product!</p>

        <h3>Reducing friction to help users painlessly achieve their goals</h3>
        <p>Based on the second round of user testing, I further revised the mockups.</p>

        <div class="card__revision">
          <h5>REDUCE FRICTION</h5>
          <p class="card">Insert a shortcut link for “Feedback” directly on the hover to reduce touchpoints</p>

        <div class="card__revision">
          <h5>PROVIDE GUIDANCE</h5>
          <p class="card">Added a short tutorial upon signing up to introduce unfamiliar features to the user</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card__revision">
          <h5>STREAMLINE FLOW</h5>

      <!-- Conclusion -->

      <section class="content__casestudy">
        <h5>CONCLUSION</h5>
        <h3>A solution that caters to a target audience</h3>
        <p>Kyodo solves the unique needs of freelancers by maintaining the features users love most about their current cloud storage apps - sharing, collaboration - and adding distinct features to improve the relationship between freelancers and their clients.</p>

        <h4>WHAT DID I LEARN?</h4>
        <ul class="text__takeaways">
          <li><p class=card"><strong>Setting clear goals for user surveys saves you from future headaches.</strong> I created the survey unclear of the direction I wanted to take with the app. This uncertainty is reflected in the results in that they don’t clearly answer my later questions regarding the freelancer target group.</p></li>
          <li><p class=card"><strong>User feedback is the highway to success.</strong> The best way to test assumptions is through user testing and preference tests. I often spent too much time pacing around, pushing pixels back and forth, unsure of what to decide. However, by getting direct user feedback, the answers quickly became clear.</p></li>
          <li><p class=card"><strong>Unfamiliar features may require some explaining.</strong> Because Kyodo’s feedback feature was brand new, many users had a hard time understanding how to complete that task. Although I was initially wary of including a tutorial (to minimize road-blockers) but after the user testing sessions, I realized they can be helpful in these situations.</p></li>
        </ul>

        <h4>WHAT WOULD I DO DIFFERENTLY?</h4>
        <ul class="text__takeaways">
          <li><p class=card"><strong>Focus on more distinctive features for freelancers.</strong> I wanted Kyodo to stand out from the competitors, but with only one distinct feature, I feel it was not enough. I would add one or two more to emphasize how Kyodo is specifically designed for freelancers. For example: payment submission, where clients must pay freelancers in order to receive their final deliverables. The idea is to alleviate freelancers not receiving timely payments from clients. However, this would require more testing to validate!</p></li>
          <li><p class=card"><strong>Conduct more follow-up user research targeted to freelancers.</strong> Because I defined Kyodo’s project scope as a cloud storage app for freelancers after conducting my user survey, I would create another user survey to ask more specific questions for the freelancing community. This would improve the solution to meet the target audience’s needs.</p></li>
        </ul>
